There are many different data visualization techniques that can be used to interpret and present data, from bar graphs, to box plots. If you had asked me to analyze and present a given data set just a few months ago, I would have created a bar graph or even maybe even a pie chart. But in the past few months, I have learned that pie charts aren't so easy on the eye and while bar charts can be a great choice, heat maps have taken the lead spot as my go-to for analyzing and presenting data.

It's not that I wouldn't have chosen to work with a heat map in the past, it's just that I wasn't as familiar with them. Of course, I have seen them, they are widely used. But if I was given a large data set, I didn't have the knowledge of how to create one.  Heat maps really come in handy when you are given a large set of data and you don't know what trends exist within it. The heat map uses a color-coded matrix to draw your attention to parts of the data that matter the most, saving time sifting through numerical data trying to find important trends among the set.

When I am given a large set of data now, my first thought is to create a heat map to get a fast glance of the data. A heat map won't tell me all I want to know about the data, but it is a great place to start by pointing me in the direction what to do next with the data. 

It's ability to communicate data quickly is what makes it one of my favorite data visualization techniques.
