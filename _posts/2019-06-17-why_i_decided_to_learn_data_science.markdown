For the past few years, I have worked in medical billing. I knew I didn't want to continue in medical billing for my entire life, but I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. For about the past 15 months, I had shadowed the billing analyst in my office, learning their role in the company. I found the work interesting. The data was useful, we found ways for the company to make more money and we turned our data findings into presentable information others without an analyst background could understand.

Having a medical coding certificate is encouraged as part of my current position and the billing analyst position. The six-month course to prepare for the almost six-hour test is offered about every other year through my company. The course is not required to sit for the test, so I decided to prepare on my own. In less than three months, I sat for the CPC exam and passed.

Passing the CPC exam gave me the encouragement I needed to continue my education. I began researching master’s programs for data analytics. During my research, master’s programs for data science would appear in my search. My focus shifted from data analytics to data science. The data science programs incorporated more computer programming in the curriculum and more programs were offered online. 

One of the biggest reasons I decided to learn data science was the flexibility. Flexibility brought me to Flatiron as opposed to a traditional master’s program. And flexibility in my future career is very important to me.

I look forward to help businesses grow and play an important part in their success.
